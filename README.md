# php-bulletin-board

First try to use a site engine.

You can choose the category of advertisement and see them, you can add a new ad in this topic as well.
All the ads and categories are placed in SQL database.

How to try it:

1. OSPanel required
2. Open PMA -> Log in -> Click 'Import' on the top of page -> Choose 'bulletin-board.sql' -> Import
3. Now print in your adress bar 'http://bulletin-board/categories'

Of course you need OSPanel to be launched.
